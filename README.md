# Implementation of Convolution 2D Layer 

## Overview
In Image Processing, Convolution layers are the basic operator for performing various tasks such as Filtering, Edge Detection, Blurring and Feature Extraction. The process of Convolution 2D layer invloves applying kernel to the input image to obtain the "Convoluted Image".
